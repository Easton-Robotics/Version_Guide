Guide to features and functions planned for current and future versions.

This readme describes the general plan for versions of the ermmi(TM) robotic system in versions of a prototype, each successive version building on the previous ones.

Version 1 - Version 1 was a very elementary prototype started in early 2020 using a crude platform, four motors with a chain drive, an Intel camera, Arduino, and Jetson Nano computer.  Due to problems with the lack of precision in dimensions, the version was abandoned in late 2020 in favor of a more rigorous approach.

Version 2 - Version 2 was started at the end of 2020 with a goal of concentrating on the software rather than the mechanical aspects of a completely custom platform.  Therefore the majority of effort is on software with plans to use a commercially available robot platform.  Specific functions are row-wise navigation, crop row detection, weed detection, and target detection methods of navigation. The presumption is that the off-the-shelf robot will include manual navigation and certain other functions.  The steering for version 2 is differential steering.  The dimensions of the AGV are somewhat irrelevant since the focus is on navigation.

Version 3 - Version 3 will be a further expansion of the development of software, incorporating LiDAR and guidance systems.  Version 3 will also include ...

Version 4 - Version 4 will be ...

Version 5 - Version 5 will be ...

Version 6 - Version 6 will be ...
