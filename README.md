## Guide to features and functions planned for current and future versions.

This readme describes the general plan for versions of the ermmi(TM) robotic system in versions of a prototype, each successive version building on the previous ones.

### Version 1

Version 1 was a very elementary prototype started in early 2020 using a crude platform, four motors with a chain drive, an Intel camera, Arduino, and Jetson Nano computer.  Due to problems with the lack of precision in dimensions, the version was abandoned in late 2020 in favor of a more rigorous approach.

### Version 2

Version 2 was started at the end of 2020 with a goal of concentrating on the software rather than the mechanical aspects of a completely custom platform.  Therefore the majority of effort is on software with plans to use a commercially available robot platform.  Specific functions are row-wise navigation, crop row detection, weed detection, and target detection methods of navigation. The presumption is that the off-the-shelf robot will include manual navigation and certain other functions.  The steering for version 2 is differential steering.  The dimensions of the AGV are somewhat irrelevant since the focus is on navigation.
Version 2.1 - due March 1, 2021 - components are:  
    pre-built Superdroid platform, four motors, encoders, differential steering
    LIDAR
    RTK, GNSS, GPS module
    software:
        crop & row detection - custom
        
Version 2.2 - due April 1, 2021

Version 2.3 - due May 1, 2021
